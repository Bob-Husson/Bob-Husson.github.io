<center><h1>The Cast - Curtain Call<br><br></h1></center>
The show ran for about 2 hours, twenty minutes and was physically demanding for the entire cast. There were 
thirteen performances and the run was almost a complete sellout. The agent of one of the members of the chorus  
couldn't even get in one night.<br><br> 
Thanks for visiting! Hope you enjoyed it.
